    "If you want to display the length distribution of the passwords, a histogram would be much better suited than the simple plot from the [previous exercise](#2.8-A-simple-plot). In matplotlib you can do this with the function `plt.bar()`. Compared to `plt.plot()` this function requires both the x-values and the y-data (height) to display anything.\n",

This was a perfectly fine approach since most of the tasks required just a few lines of code and you never had to use more than one for-loop. Wrapping a task in a function makes sense as soon you have to repeat the task many times.\n",

Implementing the computation of the digit sum in a function will therefore make your code a lot more readable and reusable since you just have to call `compute_digit_sum(password)` for every password in the dataset. You can use the following template to write your own function for the computation of the sum of digits:\n",

    "## 2.11 Labeling data in plots\n",
    "When you have multiple lines and/or markers in a single plot, you want to label the data and display the labels in a legend. In matplotlib all the plot functions such as `plt.plot()`, `plt.bar()` etc. have the optional string parameter `label` that allows you to label the data. You can then add a legend to the plot where the markers/lines will be displayed next to their labels. See the following code snippet that creates a simple line plot with a label and a legend:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plt.plot(-np.arange(10) / 2, \"r-\", label=\"something linear\")\n",
    "plt.legend()\n",
    "```\n",
    "All labels that are assigned in the same cell before calling `plt.legend()` will be included in the legend. You should therefore call `plt.legend()` at tne end of a cell. If you want to exclude something from the legend, just omit the parameter `label` for that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To include some \"dynamic\" information about the dataset in a label or a title, you can use string formatting to include variables in a string. The recommended way is to use so-called f-strings where the variables are just written directly in the string. As an example, consider a plot where the length distribution of the passwords with a digit sum lower than the value of the variable `max_digit_sum` is shown. You can then use the variable `max_digit_sum` to create the following title:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plt.title(f\"Length distribution of passwords with a digit sum lower than {max_digit_sum}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an f-string that presents a password from the dataset including all the properties of the password that you have computed in this notebook.\n",
    "2. Plot the digit sums as a function of the password length and label the axes accordingly. Use a reasonable format to display the data.\n",
    "3. Compute the maximum possible digit sum as a function of the password length and include this in the plot by calling `plt.plot()` for a second time.\n",
    "4. Assign labels to all the data with the `label` parameter and add a legend to the plot. How can you change the position of the legend in the plot?\n",
    "5. Add a title to the plot that includes the number of passwords in the dataset using an f-string"

    "## EXTRA: Sorting the character counts\n",
    "The plots in the previous exercise look a bit messy since the character count data is not ordered in any reasonable way. Due to the iteration over the passwords and the characters, the characters are currently just ordered by their first occurrence in the password dataset. For all three categories it would be nice to sort the values in descending order such that the characters are ordered by their frequencies from left to right in the plot. Alternatively, you could also sort the alphabetic data by the keys in alphabetic order (meaning \"A\" to \"Z\"), and you could sort the numeric data by the keys in numeric order (meaning \"0\" to \"9\").  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two options to approach the sorting. You can either use the native Python function `sorted()` or you can make use of the NumPy package and the functions `np.sort()` and `np.argsort()`. If you want to try the former option, read the section on using the `key` parameter in the `sorted()` function [here](https://realpython.com/sort-python-dictionary/#using-the-key-parameter-and-lambda-functions). If you want to use the NumPy approach, just read the remaining instructions in this exercise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though NumPy is optimized for numerical data, the sorting functions also work for string data. If you sort an array of strings, it is ordered alphabetically from \"A\" to \"Z\" based on the first character in each string. Even though this might sound a bit complicated, this approach is used whenever strings have to be sorted, for example books in a library. The catch here is that you have to sort the keys together with the values, but to use the NumPy functions you need to separate the keys and values into two arrays. Note that you cannot directly create arrays from the dictionary keys and dictionary values, you have to pass them to the built-in function `list()` before turning them into an array.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "keys = np.array(list(alphabetic_counts.keys()))\n",
    "values = np.array(list(alphabetic_counts.values()))\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will convert the keys and values to NumPy data types. While this might look a bit odd when printing the arrays/dictionaries, this is not an issue for any further analysis or plotting. You can call `np.array()` with the argument `dtype=object` to conserve the native data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `np.sort()` can sort the arrays individually but if you want to keep the arrays aligned during the sorting, you have to use the function `np.argsort()`. Instead of the sorted array, this function will return indices that you can use to sort both arrays (the keys and the values).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function that accepts a dictionary and returns a new dictionary that is sorted by the keys. Use your preferred approach to do the sorting.\n",
    "2. Continue with the function from task 1. Add a string parameter `by` that decides whether the dictionary is sorted by the `\"keys\"` or by the `\"values\"`. Also add a boolean parameter `ascending` that decides the order of the sorting. \n",
    "3. Start with the alphabetic character counts (you can use the dictionaries from the [previous exercise](#2.12-Counting-characters)). Sort the dictionary by the keys/values in descending/ascending order and display it in a bar plot. Don't forget to add axis labels and a title! Which sorting option (`by` and `ascending`) is your favorite one?\n",
    "4. Also display the numeric character counts. Reconsider which (sorting) key and order are most suitable to display the data.\n",
    "5. Display all three categories (alphabetic, numeric and special) in one plot. Call the function `plt.bar()` individually for each category to automatically get the bars in different colors. Label the data and add a legend to the plot."
