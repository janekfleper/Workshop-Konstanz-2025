    "## 3.1 Loading passwords with a function\n",
    "In the last notebook you learned how to read passwords from a text file. Since you are going to reuse this code many times, it is a perfect candidate to be implemented in a function. The function needs to have one (string) parameter which is the name of the file, and the function should return the preprocessed (all `\"\\n\"` removed) and filtered (no empty passwords) list of passwords. You can use the following template for the function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def load_passwords(path):\n",
    "    # load the passwords here\n",
    "    return passwords\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Write the function that returns a list of passwords from a text file. Copy the template above or write the function from scratch.\n",
    "2. What happens if you call the function without any argument `load_passwords()`? The error message will tell you exactly what is wrong with the function call.\n",
    "3. Load the passwords from the file `passwords.txt` into a list. How many passwords are left after the preprocessing and filtering?\n",
    "4. Count the number of passwords in the list that _only_ contain alphabetic characters, numeric characters or special characters respectively. Try to use list comprehensions wherever possible. An example for a password with only special characters is `\"!?:\"`. Examples for a purely alphabetic password or a purely numeric password are `\"abc\"` and `\"123\"` respectively.\n",
    "5. EXTRA: Add a boolean parameter called `load_empty` that allows you to optionally load empty passwords. If you call the function with the argument `load_empty=True`, the empty lines will be included in the list of passwords."

Sorting the arrays by the counts in descending order would make a lot more sense, the most recurring passwords would then come first in the arrays. If you just want to sort the array of counts, you can directly do that with the function `np.sort()`. By default the counts will be sorted in ascending order but you can reverse the array with the indexing `[::-1]`. See the following code snippet to sort an array in descending order:\n",

In principle, you could stack the three arrays from the previous exercise to create a two-dimensional NumPy array. The data would then remain aligned if you change the order in any way. However, since one of the arrays stores string data and the other two arrays store integer data, this data is not suitable to be combined in a single array.  \n",

A data frame has an index (as an identifier of the rows) and columns to store the data. Each column in the data frame works just like a NumPy array, but the columns are not required to have the same data type. A data frame is therefore suited to store mixed data, such as your passwords, their counts and their lengths. See the following code snippet to create a data frame from the (unsorted) arrays:\n",
    "```python\n",
