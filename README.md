# Workshop-Konstanz-2025

Introduction to Data Analysis with Python

During this three-day workshop, you will learn the fundamentals of data analysis and data visualization in Python. The goal is to prepare you to work on your own data. You will complete exercises in Jupyter notebooks and become familiar with NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas, which form the foundation of the scientific Python ecosystem. These exercises use a real dataset to showcase some of the issues you might face when working with real data.
