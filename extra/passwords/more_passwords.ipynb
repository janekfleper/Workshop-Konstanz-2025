    "## 4.2 Loading a file into a data frame\n",
    "In practice you should always try to use a function \n",
    "If your data has a fixed format, you can load a file directly into a data frame. There are many functions available such as `pd.read_csv()`, `pd.read_excel()`, `pd.read_hdf()` etc... For a list of all supported formats please see the [user guide on IO tools](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/io.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the passwords are all in separate lines in the file, the most suitable function is `pd.read_table(name)` which just reads data from a generic table in a file called `name`. Since there is no header specified in the file, you have to call the function with the keyword argument `header=None`. If you want to name the column(s) manually, you can pass a list to the keyword argument `names` with the column name(s). Conveniently, the function `pd.read_table()` will automatically remove the newline characters and it will skip empty lines. You therefore do not have to do any preprocessing or filtering (for now).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you load a lot of data from a file, errors can always happen. If a line has a bad format, an invalid character or any other issue, the line should just be skipped to allow the file to be loaded regardless. You can then check the line manually or use another tool to resolve the error. The corresponding keyword argument to skip bad lines is called `on_bad_lines`, and if you pass the value `\"warn\"` you will receive a warning for each line that was skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `passwords.txt` in todays directory contains ~1 million passwords. If you would rather continue working with a smaller sample size, please use the file `day3/passwords.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the function `pd.read_table(name, header=None)` to load your passwords into a data frame. If there is an error when loading the file, also use the argument `on_bad_lines=\"warn\"`. What is the name of the password column in the data frame?\n",
    "2. Use the keyword argument `names` to change the name of the column when loading the file into a data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Load the passwords again, and prepare the data frame with all the columns from yesterday. The index should contain the **unique** passwords and you should have the counts, the lengths, the digit sums, the number of alphabetic characters and the number of numeric characters in the data frame. -->"

    "## 4.4 Creating multiple plots in one figure\n",
    "So far you have only used the functions `plt.plot()`, `plt.bar()` etc. that automatically create a figure with a single plot (which is also called axis). The Jupyter environment will automatically call the function `plt.show()` for you at the end of the cell to actually display the figure/plot.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to have multiple plots/axes in one figure, you have to define the shape of the figure beforehand. The corresponding function in matplotlib is `plt.subplots()` where you can specify how many rows and columns of axes you want to have in the figure. As an example, if you want to create three axes in a row, you can use the following code snippet:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols=3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The function will return a figure and an array of axes and they will be automatically displayed if you execute the cell. Instead of calling `plt.plot()`, you can now plot something in a specific axes by calling `axs[i].plot()`. The arguments will be the same, you can pass the x-values, the y-data and some styling just like in `plt.plot()`. See the following code snippet that will create two axes showing different linear functions:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols=2)\n",
    "axs[0].plot(np.arange(10))\n",
    "axs[1].plot(-np.arange(40))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to plot something directly from a data frame, you have to tell the data frame method which axis you want to use. For example, if you want to plot the digit sum (in the column `\"digit_sum\"`) as a function of the number of alphabetic characters (in the column `\"n_alphabetic\"`) in the second axis of the figure, you can use the following code snippet:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols=3)\n",
    "df.plot(\"n_alphabetic\", \"digit_sum\", kind=\"scatter\", ax=axs[1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to change the overall size of the figure, you can pass a list with the width and the height to the parameter `figsize` of the function `plt.subplots()`. As an example, see the following code snippet that will return a very wide figure with two axes:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=[20, 4])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To save your figure at the end of the cell, you can use the method `fig.savefig(name)` with the `name` of the figure. See the following code snippet to create a new figure with three empty axes, and to save it to the file `\"plot.png\"` at the end of the cell:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols=3)\n",
    "fig.savefig(\"plot.png\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new figure with three empty axes in one column. If you do not like the aspect ratio, use the parameter `figsize` to change the size of the figure.\n",
    "2. Create a new figure with two axes in one row. Show the digit sum as a function of the password length in the first axes, and show the digit sum as a function of the number of numeric characters in the second axes. In both axes, display the maximum possible digit sum. Assign labels to all the data and add a legend.\n",
    "3. Create a new figure with two axes in one row. Display different columns from the data frame in the two axes. Save the figure and open the file on your own device to check that everything looks as expected.\n",
    "4. EXTRA: Create a figure with 4 axes in 2 rows. How do you have to index the `axs` to select the individual plots? Fill the axes with some data from the data frame. Call `fig.set_tight_layout(True)` if the axes are overlapping with the labels."
