Unfortunately, checking a string for special characters such as `\"!\"`, `\"?\"` etc... is not implemented as a string method ([source](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp)).

As you (implicitely) learned in [exercise 1.5](#1.5-Categorizing-the-characters), the `elif` statement and the `else` statement are optional. If you don't need to handle the case(s) where the initial condition is `False`, it is perfectly fine to just use the `if` statement.\n",

    "## 1.11 Dictionary iteration\n",
    "Iterating over the key-value pairs in a dictionary works very similar to lists. Directly iterating over the dictionary will implicitely iterate over the keys. To explicitely iterate over the keys, you can also use the dictionary method `keys()`. The following two `for` loops are therefore equivalent:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for key in character_count:\n",
    "    print(key)\n",
    "\n",
    "for key in character_count.keys():\n",
    "    print(key)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The second `for` loop makes your code easier to read in exchange for a slightly longer line. This is ultimately a matter of personal preference, you should however not underestimate the value of code readability!    \n",
    "You can also iterate over the values with the method `values()` and the key-value pairs with the method `items()`. In the latter case you get a tuple `(key, value)` in each step of the iteration. You can use two loop variables to directly unpack the tuple during the iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Either use the `character_count` dictionary from [exercise 1.10](#1.10-Counting-characters) or create a new dictionary with a few key-value pairs.\n",
    "2. Try the `for` loops to iterate over the dictionary keys, values and items. Be creative and think of small tasks that you can solve with the loops.\n",
    "3. Combine the dictionary `for` loops with `enumerate()`. How do you have to arrange the index, the key and the value to unpack the loop over the `items()`?\n",
    "4. Compute the sum of the values in the dictionary in a single line of code. If you used the `character_count` dictionary, the sum has to match the length of the password."

    "## EXTRA: Your Password Game\n",
    "This is a creative exercise where you can just make up your own password rules. Your partner (or someone from another team) then has to find a password that fulfills all those rules. I got the idea for this exercise from [The Password Game](https://neal.fun/password-game/) by Neal Agarwal. Check out the game if you want some inspiration for possible password rules.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Each rule has to be implemented as a function that accepts the current password as a parameter and returns the description and the boolean result of the rule. As an example, see the following rule that requires a minimum length of 3 characters for the password:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def minimum_length(password):\n",
    "    result = len(password) >= 3\n",
    "    return \"Your password must have at least 3 characters\", result\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are going to learn the details about functions tomorrow. For this exercise it is enough if you just copy the example function and change the name `minimum_length` to something unique for each rule. You can pass any number of rule functions in a list to the `PasswordGame()`. Inside each function you can check anything you want about the password. Using the things you learned today in the earlier exercises should already allow you to write quite a few rules. If this is not enough for you, look online or ask around for help to create more complex rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the cell that defines the class `PasswordGame` once. (I added some comments if you are curious about the implementation of the game)\n",
    "2. Copy (and rename!) the function `minimum_length()` to implement as many rules as you want. Add all functions to the `rules` list.\n",
    "3. Run the cell `game = PasswordGame(rules)` to play the game. If you want to update the rules or restart the game, just run the cell again."

    "## EXTRA: Making a password more secure\n",
    "This exercise is a follow-up to the [first EXTRA exercise](#EXTRA:-Improving-the-password-policy) about improving the password policy. Make sure to solve this one before starting this exercise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The password policy in this exercise uses mixed requirements from the earlier two password policies. If you want to make this exercise easier/more difficult, you can slightly modify the requirements to your liking. E.g. you can add the maximum allowed length of 16 or you can drop the numeric character requirement.\n",
    "1. The length of the password must be at least 8 characters\n",
    "2. The password must contain lower-case characters and upper-case characters\n",
    "3. The password must contain at least one numeric character\n",
    "\n",
    "If a password is not considered to be secure enough, it would be convenient to have an algorithm that automatically modifies the password to meet the security requirements. Just appending `\"aA1\"` to every password to meet the latter two requirements would be too easy to crack. The modification(s) should therefore depend on the original password. You can do this with the string methods that are built into Python. For a list of available methods see https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp or find another resource online.  \n",
    "Since strings cannot be modified in place in Python (they are immutable) the best approach is to work with a list of the individual characters. You can then replace/modify the characters by assigning a new/modified character to the corresponding index in the list. After the modification(s) you can turn the list of characters into a string again with the method `\"\".join()`. See the following code snippet as an illustration. In the password `\"hello\"` the character `\"e\"` is manually replaced by the character `\"3\"` to fulfill the numeric requirement:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "password = \"hello\"\n",
    "characters = [char for char in password]\n",
    "characters[1] = \"3\"\n",
    "modified_password = \"\".join(characters)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer**: Passwords with these simple modifications are still considered to be weak according to [wikipedia/password_strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength#Examples_of_weak_passwords) and [wikipedia/password_cracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking#Easy_to_remember,_hard_to_guess) since these checks can be easily automated. Nevertheless, it's a good exercise on working with strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write the code to make any password pass the requirements above. You can follow the next bullet points or you can get creative and try to find your own solution.\n",
    "- If there is no lower/upper-case character, replace the first suitable character with its upper/lower-case counterpart.\n",
    "- If there is no numeric character, replace the first suitable character (lower-case or upper-case) by its [leet-speak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet#Table_of_leet-speak_substitutes_for_normal_letters) counterpart. The most common options are `E->3, S->5, B->8, I->1, A->4`.\n",
    "- If the password is not long enough, repeat it until the minimum required length is reached/exceeded.\n",
    "- If you cannot automatically modify the password to meet the requirements, print a message that states why the modification failed.\n",
    "- If you were able to automatically modify the password, print a message that contains the new password.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test your password modification you can try the cases from the table below. Copy the initial password from the table and check if your modified password looks the same. Some of the impossible modifications assume that only the \"most common\" numeric replacements from the exercise are used. If you included more replacments, the modification might be possible anyway.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**It's perfectly fine if your password modification algorithm does not work for all of the last five examples from the table, these are some special edge cases to push the boundaries of the modification algorithm. If you want to improve your algorithm, make sure that you understand where/why the edge cases failed beforehand.**\n",
